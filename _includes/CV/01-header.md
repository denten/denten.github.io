bio:

- short: "A literary scholar researching the confluence of texts, people, and technology."

  long: "I am an Associate Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature, Columbia University. A former software engineer at Microsoft and currently faculty associate at Columbia's Data Science Institute, I am the author of *Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation* (Stanford University Press, 2017). My second book explores the automation of literary labor and the rise of creative artificial intelligence. My research appears on the pages of *Amodern*, *boundary2*, *Computational Culture*, *Modernism/modernity*, *Modern Philology*, and *New Literary History* on topics that include narratology, the sociology of literature, media history, and literary theory. I am a co-founder of Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research, a collective whose work has received numerous awards, major grants, and recognition from the press in *The New York Times*, *Fast Company*, *Der Spiegel*, and *Le Monde*."
