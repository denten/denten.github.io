> Dennis Yi Tenen is associate professor of English and Comparative Literature
at Columbia University. His teaching and research happen at the intersection
of people, texts, and technologies. Tenen received his doctorate in
Comparative Literature at Harvard University under the advisement of
Professors Elaine Scarry and William Todd. A co-founder of Columbia's Group
for Experimental Methods in the Humanities, he is the author of *Plain Text:
The Poetics of Computation* (Stanford University Press, 2017). His recent work
appears on the pages of *New Literary History*, *Amodern*, *boundary2*,
*Computational Culture*, and *Modernism/modernity* on topics that include
literary theory, the sociology of literature, media history, and computational
narratology. His next book concerns the creative limits of artificial
intelligence.
