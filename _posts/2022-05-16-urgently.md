"Everything must be questioned. Every decision made, every plan, every operation. Critical
thought has always made me doubt. Did I make the right choices? But these doubts never left the
bounds of reason. They didn't prevent me from insisting on my point of view. There's always
risk in unit command. War doesn't make secure operations. You are always taking a risk. Above
all, you must realize that all risks were calculated; fallback plans developed. That you gave
yourself wholly to both aims: to accomplish your mission and to assure the safety of your
personnel.

Maybe that's why war is an art, not a science. Because you accomplished the mission. And
assured the safety of your personnel. You have reached the highest levels of command. More so,
when your choices were approved by your superiors. Glory to Ukraine!"

*Urgently! Message from the Commander of the Azov Regiment*, Lieutenant Colonel Prokopenko.
