Can we survive, if Ukraine does not? That is a question that all of us should ask. Are we
surprised that the forces of evil are alive and aggressive in today's world? Huh. I'm not
surprised. And you shouldn't be either. I write and sing about it because I can feel it. You
should know about it because you can see. Unless you have a blind eye to it and don't want to
do anything about it, you can see it. Those of us who who know hate, recognize the commonality
of inhumanity. It is: good versus evil, right over wrong, tyranny over liberty. This not just a
Ukrainian war---today Ukraine is in a battle for the soul of the world. As we speak, they are
fighting forces of evil. We have seen what evil has and can do. Doesn't matter what country or
color, now evil threatens the sovereignty of one country, and the sanctity of all others. What
additional tragedies will it take for us to stop this aggression? Hate has no color. Has no
loyalty. Greed has no commitment, but to itself. Only you, the people, can prevent world war
three. We must stand up to hate, and kill hate, before it kills us. I believe in the power of
the people. All the people. We can stop this. Right now.
