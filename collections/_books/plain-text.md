    Plain Text shows us that text is anything but plain―this is a sharp and imaginative
    contribution to the debates around what it means to produce, read, and process texts in the
    era of digital culture.

    An essential read for those interested in text in its many contemporary cultural contexts and
    points of impact―Tenen moves from strength to strength across (inter)disciplinary points of
    engagement with a welcome personal acuity.

    Plain Text adds to the impressive work of such computationally savvy theorists as Wendy Hui
    Kyong Chun, Alexander Galloway, Alan Liu, Rita Raley, and others to make a clear, forceful case
    for computational poetics as a necessary literary practice in the digital age.

    Ask yourself: When I write on a computer, where does that writing reside? Is it there, on the
    word document, or is it buried deep inside the hard drive? Does literature actually end in
    cryptograms, in the layers of encoding deep beneath the liquid light of a laptop screen? These
    are the questions at the heart of Dennis Tenen's important and engaging book. We're lost among
    the copper, the cables, the formats, the terms and conditions. Tenen's Plain Text provides a
    lucid and legible map to our often vertiginous computational climate.

    This book is not just about opening the black box of digital reading and writing, the devices
    and programs we use to do so, or the digital turn of our culture. Written by an English and
    Comparative Literature professor who is also a trained engineer and a migrant having moved from
    post-Soviet Russia to the "global" North-West, Plain Text is a vibrant call to rethink the two
    culture debate in broad cultural and political terms.

    Plain Text stands out as a media study that attends to the historical roots of debates about
    form and format in language. Tenen's valuable connections between long-standing critical
    engagements with poetic composition and current digital writing practices emerge from precise
    and informed attention to his sources.
