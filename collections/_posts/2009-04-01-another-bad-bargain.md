A republican assemblyman from San Diego [wants to force Google to blur Street
View images of potential terrorist
targets](http://tech.yahoo.com/news/ap/20090303/ap_on_hi_te/tec_techbit_internet_mapping),
like schools and hospitals.  

I got into an argument about the implications of such a law on [Download
Squad](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/03/04/california-targets-internet-maps-seeks-blurry-buildings/#commentform)
of all places.  Such law would be asinine I argued, because in blurring the
images the government would essentially be creating a "hit list" of potential
targets.  A terrorist not familiar with California infrastructure would need
only look at what is blurred on the map to see what the municipal government
considers to be its most vulnerable assets.  Further detail about these public
buildings would be easily accessible in person, from street level.  

The Indian courts are
[considering](http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article5311241.ece)
a similar piece of legislation in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks.  The
terrorists _may_ have used Google Earth to plan and execute their actions, but
remember that they also have used boats, automobiles, and cellular phones.
And together with Google services these same technologies allowed for the
efficient operation of the rescue efforts.  

"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety,
deserve neither liberty nor safety," Benjamin Franklin
[wrote](http://books.google.com/books?id=W2MFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA270&lpg=PA270t#PPA270,M1)
in 1775. Street View is not an essential liberty, but open access to
technology and information is essential.  It empowers all citizens, and we
should make sure we don't trade it, piecemeal, for some provisional notions of
security.
