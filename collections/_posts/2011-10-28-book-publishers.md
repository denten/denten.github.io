Dear Book Publishers,

Please stop making me pay twice for your products. My library spans hundreds
of volumes, many in duplicate for classroom use. I don't see why I should pay
full price for the digital versions. Let me pay a small upgrade fee for an
online copy, or better yet, offer a subscription service to your catalog. See
http://oreilly.com/ for details. With best regards,

DT
