phenomena only in so far as we ourselves experiment and, in hospitals,
amphitheaters, or laboratories, stir the fetid or throbbing ground of life.

reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen.

Claude Bernard, *An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine* (New
York: Dover Publications, 1957), 15.
