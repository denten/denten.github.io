"Pragmatism is a rejection of hierarchical structure itself, of the
stabilizing (kingly) forces of structure, which would always stand safely
outside structure---outside the game, but ruling the game. Pragmatism is a
commitment to the openness of time and a chance to for change; pragmatism,
then, is the expression of the radical democrat and the experimental method,
or scientific spirit of democracy."

Frank Lentricchia, *Criticism and Social Change* (University Of Chicago Press,
1985), 3.
