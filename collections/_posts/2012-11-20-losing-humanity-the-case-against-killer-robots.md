An [interesting
report](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/11/19/losing-humanity-0) written by
the Human Rights Watch relevant to my [Beyond the
Human](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWElPChwL5P5K6xqDjNhdVBRCimroFecKo1xlupGCoo/edit)
course.

>This 50-page report outlines concerns about these fully autonomous weapons,
which would inherently lack human qualities that provide legal and non-legal
checks on the killing of civilians. In addition, the obstacles to holding
anyone accountable for harm caused by the weapons would weaken the lawâ€™s power
to deter future violations.
