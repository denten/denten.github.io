My first deposit to the university's [Academic
Commons](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/):

> The Studio at Butler Library, as we imagine it, will host mix of scheduled
> events loosely related to digital humanities, along with providing an
> unstructured, community-driven workspace for all those interested in the
> applied aspects of book culture, data curation, knowledge design, big
> history, complex social systems, experimental philosophy and criticism,
> cultural analytics, network analysis, computational modeling, text mining,
> data visualization, and critical making.
