The university paper recently asked me to comment on the University of
Chicago's free speech principles, which "affirm the University's tolerance for
all expressions of speech."[^1] This is an issue that deeply affects my
thoughts, research, and teaching practice. My response, for the record, was as
follows:

> Freedom of speech is an enviable ideal. Its practical
affirmation requires also that we acknowledge systemic inequities of access
and expression which have historically privileged certain modes of speaking
over others. Freedom in that sense is not a neutral, universal concept. Given
complete freedom, free speech favors existing power structures: the loudest
voices will continue to gain volume and dominate. Their impact does not always
come from reason: it relies also on a legacy of suppression, violence, and
subjugation. It is not enough then for speech to be free. It must also be
just, for without justice there can be neither peace nor dialogue.

I ask that the above be quoted in full.
