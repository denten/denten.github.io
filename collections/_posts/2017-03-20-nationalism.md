For the past few days I have been exploring some deep, unsavory recesses of
the Russian Internet, or Runet. As a former Soviet subject, I follow Russian
politics with a morbid and distant fascination. From New York, Russia can look
both like retrograde second world---a fallen empire, clinging to its colonial
past---and, at the same time, an advanced, global kleptocracy, which has not
only foreshadowed our current political predicament, but is also a harbinger
of our future. The collusion between Trump and Putin underscores the
importance of the comparison.
