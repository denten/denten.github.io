These comments are a short response to the important piece by Chad Wellmon and
Andrew Piper's  "[Publication, Power, and Patronage: On Inequality and
Academic
Publishing](http://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/publication_power_and_patronage_on_inequality_and_academic_publishing/)"
appearing in *Critical Inquiry*, published on July 21st, 2017.  1. 

We are extremely pleased to see quantitative work beginning to appear in
journals such as *Critical Inquiry*. Piper and Wellmon model smart, incisive,
"mixed methods" scholarship. They conclude powerfully: 

> We would argue that the answer is neither a return to ideals of
> incalculability nor a belief in the power of free knowledge. Using new
> digital technologies and methods to better understand academic institutions
> does not necessarily make one complicit in the “neoliberal” university or
> exacerbate the “inequality both between ‘the haves’ of digital humanities
> and the ‘have-nots’ of mainstream humanities.” Wisely used, such
> technologies and methods can help reveal how longstanding, persistent, and
> intractable such disparities have been. What we need in our view is not less
> quantification but more; not less mediation but mediation of a different
> kind. It is not enough to demand intellectual diversity and assume its
> benefits. We need new ways of measuring, nurturing, valuing, and,
> ultimately, conceiving of it.  

We offer the following, mostly methodological, comments with anticipation of
seeing more exciting research on this topic from this team and others in the
field.  

1. Our intuition, supported by research in sociology of knowledge, would be
that knowledge is strongly affected by social networks. In other words,
academics from similar institutional backgrounds / circles will tend to
promote one another. This makes sense because the very idea of norms and
standards arises out of institutions such as departments, professional
associations, and conferences.[^1] 

The authors survey "over forty-five years (1969-2015) of publication data from
four leading journals in the humanities---*Critical Inquiry*, *New Literary
History*, *PMLA*, and *Representations*." From these *Critical Inquiry* was
established by Wayne Booth and others out of the University of Chicago; *New
Literary History* by Ralph Cohen out of University of Virginia; and
*Representations* by Stephen Greenblatt and Svetlata Alpers out of Berkeley.
*PMLA* is the outlier here (and in some regards in the analysis) in that it is
the official organ of a professional organization.  

We think the authors would agree that given the provenance of the journals
surveyed, the sample is not representative of academic publishing in the
humanities and social sciences at large. The results would be much different
were the authors to include a random sampling of thousands of journals, each
with distinct institutional histories. As it stands, the journals sampled
represent communities and standards of distinction particular to the
communities they represent.

Further, we derive a more general insight from the difficulty of appropriate
sampling: statistical trends becomes more meaningful when analyzed alongside
their institutional and historical contexts.  

2. The work on parity can be extended in similar ways. Parity can only make
sense in social context. In the paper, the authors track almost a half a
century of a publication record. The very meaning of parity in 1969, when the
dataset begins, is different from the meaning of parity today. The paper
assumes the optimal goal of 50% representation, which roughly tracks with
demographic distribution. But what is the underlying gender distribution of
faculty in the departments, then and now? What has been the trend for graduate
admissions and graduations? What is the relationship between the gender
composition of editorial boards and the parity of representation in the
publishing record?

The context helps us interpret the data. The publishing record could be more
or less balanced than faculty representation, which itself has changed
dramatically over time. It could be too that we (scholars and journal editors)
should seek "restorative parity," where traditionally under-represented
communities are given more share of a voice to redress a long history of
injustice. A critical conversation on what parity has meant yesterday, means
now, and should mean in the future could strengthen the argument of the paper. 

3. Finally, we write in support of the authors’ conclusion. Institutional
imbalances of the kind revealed by their research needs to be addressed
systematically and from different angles. Wellmon and Piper’s work gives us an
important diagnostic tool by which we can track whether the values we profess
theoretically align with academic practice. 

However, the numbers, as the authors remind us, are not enough. Publication is
the end product of a long institutional chain. It reflects the standards of
quality that emerge out of a community of participants. For disparity to be
addressed at its roots, we must make sure to include a diversity of voices in
the formation of institutional standards. If your journal does not publish
enough women it is likely that your editorial board and your reviewers are
disproportionately male. Coauthorship and collaboration across all
distinctions---gender and discipline---is a purposeful practice that can
reconfigure the very meaning of distinction.

Collaboration Network: Disciplinary Cohesion from 1963 to
1999](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240406900204).”
American Sociological Review 69, no. 2 (April 1, 2004): 213–38. "Recent work
in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social
interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific
collaboration networks affect scientific practice."
