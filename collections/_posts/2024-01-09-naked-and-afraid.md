Season 6 Ep. 13

[Off-screen] NATURE WILL KICK YOUR!

[Scene in a Midwestern restaurant] Mother: Now, Bree, please tell us what you are eating
for your last meal. Bree: Last meal with the family? This wasn’t planned---I got the “Fresh
and Naked Basil Pesto.” Mother” Fresh and naked?  [Father smiles.] Bree: Mmm, yeah,
hopefully I’ll be fresh and naked when I get there.

[Cut to Clarence] Okay, lets get real. My name is Clarence and I am homeless. I’ve been
homeless for a little over ten years now. I do work. Usually as a survivor instructor.
But, I don’t make enough money to have my own place. When I am not living where I work, I
am crashing on friends couches. I may not have a home, But, I have a heart. And home is
where the heart is. And that's everywhere. That's earth. My address is earth.
