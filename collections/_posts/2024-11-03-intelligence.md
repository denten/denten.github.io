L’intelligenza non sta dentro le macchine, è umana Nel suo ultimo libro Yi Tenen, docente
di letteratura alla Columbia University, pone l’intelligenza artificiale dentro un contesto
critico di Luca De Biase.

> "There is no denying it, artificial intelligence automates many tasks of intellectual work. We
need to prepare." How? "Work that is automated loses value," says Tenen. "But work that serves
to solve difficult problems, on the other hand, increases in value. The next phases of the
development of artificial intelligence will deal with the contextualization of technologies
in different cultures. Generative artificial intelligences must, for example, learn which
sentences are offensive in which society. The machine must be trained to deal with differences
in context. The best engineers are trying to understand social dynamics and humanities scholars
are becoming increasingly aware of digital technologies. There is a convergence between
disciplines. Those who understand it produce value because they participate in cutting-edge
design. This convergence is essential for problems that do not have a single right solution."
Education is transformed: "Engineering becomes a humanistic discipline. Social sciences become
technological. And work changes accordingly."

> But the success of this vision is not a given. The prevailing, more anxiety-inducing and
manipulative narratives that describe technologies destined to become ineluctably more
powerful, progressively depriving humans of their prerogatives and responsibilities, are
compatible with a system that concentrates the production and management of artificial
intelligence in a few giant global companies. "If you peel back the veil of narrative, you find
a familiar story of colonization, polarization, monopoly," says Tenen. "But knowledge is a
commons. And intelligence belongs to humanity. It's a bit like a public library."

> The impact of artificial intelligence on society is difficult to overestimate. But realism
must overcome hyperbole. AI is more complex than a parrot. But it is the result of collective,
centuries-old, human work. It does not change, deterministically, everything. But today it is
an essential dimension of the evolution of humans.
