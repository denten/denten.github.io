> Consider the case of Hollywood Writers Guild of America (WGA)—representing 11,500
screenwriters—who went on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers in May of 2023. According to the agreement reached later that year in
October, the Guild established regulations for the use of artificial intelligence, including
provisions preventing unauthorized “writing or rewriting of literary material” by automated
means. Unauthorized, in this case, entails the use of writers’ materials for machine learning
and subsequent generation of text by machines. Simply put, writers didn’t want to be replaced
by bots.

> Similar to synthetics in fashion, synthetic or “artificially generated” text implies an
obverse quality—something akin to natural or organic textiles—which human minds and bodies may
prefer to the simulated material. However, the history of industrial manufacture points to the
long-term devaluation of artisanal labor in favor of the mass produced. Fast fiction may be as
inevitable as fast fashion, and just as irresistible to the consumer. The mistake was ever to
think creative work to be exempt from the advent of automation.
