## Falling Out and In Love with an Institution (~1k words)

What does it mean to love an institution?

Perhaps it's just allergies, but I tend to get a little misty in the spring. Sitting on the
steps of the Low library, looking at our campus makes me reflect on the many conversations I
had with students and colleagues this semester---some of them as part of the listening tables
program (launched by Gil Eyal and team).

As a researcher, I'm incredibly interested in the linguistic markers of collective identity.
The collective "we" or "they" people use when discussing Columbia university (or any large
institution, really) can often be used as a diagnostic tool which signals a degree of belonging
to and, alternatively, alienation from the institution. One and the same person may talk about
"our campus" in one sentence and "their policies" in another, when discussing recent events. I
am guessing these aren't quite conscious choices: it's just the way people intuitively process
institutional complexity.

Large organizations exhibit complex emergent behavior. Imagine the city as a sort of a civil
hive mind, Plato tells us in his *Republic*. But the mind is also splintered into factions, at
war with each other. It must be somehow brought into harmony, but how? Centuries of political
thought wrestle with the question of collective identity, in one way or another. Yet in
ordinary conversation, we simply share the experience of being a tiny organelle within the
greater body of an emerging leviathan. Unable to reason about complex institutional structure
we say things like "the university decided," "has failed to take action," or any other number
of similarly reductive but still cognitively convenient statements.

Here my professional interest also intersects with the personal: a child of Soviet bureaucracy,
I am a life-long reader of bureaucratic poetry. In private, I console myself in the company of
Kafka, Gogol, Kavan, Beckett. Bureaucracies concern me in light of that tradition. "I love my
job," says a bright-eyed American colleague and I just don't have the heart to tell them that
it, the job, cannot possibly love them back. Institutions are incapable of love (I think to
myself) or hate for that matter.

Consider that to demand emotion from an institution is to commit a category error. The
philosopher Gilbert Ryle tells the story of a visitor who, after touring various buildings at
Oxford University, asked, "But where is the university?" Despite our cognitive shortcuts, the
university simply isn't one concrete, localized thing among others like individual people and
buildings. It is a conceptual entity rather, composed of sundry relationships between people,
habits, texts, things. It includes the Medical School and the Engineering, parks and labs,
libraries, dorm rooms, and cafes. The English Department is part of that university, as well as
the rowing team, the custodial staff, kindergartens, CUIT, a statue of a splattered horse
by Jacques Lipchitz, parents and alums, students and visiting scholars, along with many other
fascinating constituents.

How all of that complexity is supposed to take a unified view on any political situation is
beyond me. To love or hate it is an impossible task. For this reason, I don't envy the position
of our recent presidents---Bollinger, Shafik, Armstrong, Shipman. These are singular people
who must nevertheless embody the metaphor of a sprawling leviathan. To demand unity from them
implies the unification of the underlying constituency. At best, such a process must involve
careful political deliberation. At worst, the demand for unilateral action risks creating the
appearance of consensus where none exists. In other words, ethics (or love) isn't something
that can be demanded of the university nor dispensed from above by decree. Love is something
that we can only ask of each other.

So what can it possibly mean to love or hate an institution? In reflecting on my own
experiences, I think fondly of the people who welcomed me here a little over a decade ago
and made me feel at home. I think of colleagues in the English Department and the Institute
of Comparative literature. I think of the care with which we discuss problems, the amount
of quietly satisfying work that goes into mentoring students. I think of the Core, and the
people who make it special, from the staff to the students---students who still keep in touch
(hello Sunny and Elena!) after many years. I think of friends in the Journalism school like
Mark Hansen and Marguerite Holloway, who encouraged my early work. I think of our library,
which has been hosting my lab for many years, and of librarians like John Tofanelli, with whom
I converged in the stacks once in the mutual pursuit of an obscure source. I think of the
Narrative Workshop and the graduate students, Amy and Dian, who manged to build such a vibrant
research community at the Incite Institute. I think of the recent silent faculty vigils in
support of our students and of professional organizations like the AAUP which are leading the
defense of the university. I think of many more people and communities that touched my life,
all filed mentally under "Columbia."

Back at the listening table, I wish I could have made these points more clearly: In times
of trouble, under immense political pressure from every side, all we can do in turn to each
other for support. I know it's sappy to say---it must be the allergies speaking---but Columbia is
us. There isn't some other "they" standing in opposition. Let's not mistake the difficulty of
collective action for negligence or malice. It's just us here. And we are an uniquely varied,
scrappy, sometimes frustrating, but always excellent bunch of New Yorkers.

There's a blessed moment in early spring, just as the weather gets nice, but before the
commencement takes over campus, where people take to the steps at Low library. From that
vantage, the Alma Mater looks regal on the one hand (holding the scepter). Her other hand
is turned to the sky as if to say, "Eh? What do you think? This is pretty good, right?" I
remember sitting exactly here in the dead of winter twelve years ago, after my first campus
visit. The Butler library sparkled in the cold like a Victorian wedding cake but my stomach was
already falling in the anticipation of future nostalgia. And I thought, "Yeah, it's going to be
incredible."
